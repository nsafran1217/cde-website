                            <p>Sun Microsystems was my first exposure to Unix workstations. Back in 2017, I posted a wanted ad on craigslist and somebody actually responded. I went to their damp basement and picked up 4 rusty workstations, 4 keyboards, and 3 mice, and 1 monitor for $100. 2 keyboards and 1 mouse were not salvageable.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, the monitor was broken. At that time, CRTs were still being given away for free, so I just got rid of it. Today, I would attempt to fix it.</p>
                            <p>I'm still looking for a pre-SPARC Sun system, and maybe an Ultra 2 with dual processors. The S-BUS system interest me more than the later PCI systems.</p>
