            <p>
            I wanted to try out wire wrap, but I didn't have enough space on the back of the board,
            or any wire wrap sockets. So, I soldered pin headers on either side of the ICs and wire
            wrapped on the top of the board. Its not the nicest looking wire wrap, but I'm happy
            with how it came out. It's also easy than doing point to point soldering in my opinion.

            I designed. I was planning to read the time from an i2C clock chip by bit banging with the PIO.
