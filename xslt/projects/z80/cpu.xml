            <h2>Z80 CPU and Memory Board</h2>
            <p>
            This was the first board I built for the computer. I'm not happy with how it looks, but
            it works. I improved my construction techniques in the later boards.<br></br>
            This board has the z80 CPU, Flash, SRAM, an OR gate for memory address decoding, 
            a 3 to 8 demux for IO address decoding, and a latch that disables the ROM.
            </p>
            <p>The only change I needed to make to this board was adding the latch and IO decoding.</p>
