            <h2>Z80 IDE Interface Board</h2>
            <p>
            Currently this board is very simple because only the IDE part is implemented.
            Eventually, a floppy controller will be added to this board.<br></br>
            The hard disk is connected directly to the Z80's bus. 
            I'm considering re-making this board and adding bus
            transceivers for both the IDE disk and the FDD controller.<br></br>
            So far, I've only found 1 model of hard disk that works with this setup, 
            and I'm assuming its because there's no bus transceiver. 
            Only 8 bits of the 16 bit data bus on the hard disk is used. The other
            top 8 are pulled to ground. The only chip on the board is a 3 to 8 demux for address
            decoding.
