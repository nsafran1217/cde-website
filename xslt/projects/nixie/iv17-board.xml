            <p>This board now has a permanent home in my <a href="/projects/nixie/weather-clock.html">Nixie/VFD Weather clock</a></p>
            <p>
            I finally built a case for this board, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">though I still don't have a permanent use for it.</span> 
            I 3d printed a case that let me fit the 2 power supplies and connectors in one place.
            </p>
            <p>I wrote a few assembly routines to use the display with my z80 computer. It uses the z80-pio to talk to it.</p>
            <p>
            The assembly is in the files called "iv17*.s" in my GitHub repo for my computer:<br></br>
            <a href="https://github.com/nsafran1217/z80-asm/tree/master/myCode/DeviceDemos">https://github.com/nsafran1217/z80-asm/tree/master/myCode/DeviceDemos</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            As a part of this, I also wrote a simple clock program with an RTCDS3231 connected to the z80-pio. I bit-banged the i2c.<br></br>
            If anyone is looking for examples of i2c bit banging on the z80, look at i2c.s and RTCDS3231bitBang.s. clock-iv17.s puts it all together into one program.
