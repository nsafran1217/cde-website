            <h2>Modern Linux on SGI Altix</h2>
            <p>
            I recently purchased two SGI Altixes, <a href="/computers/sgi/altix.html">an Altix 350 and Altix 3700</a>. The factory OS for these comptuers is SuSE Enterpirse Linux Server 9, 10, or 11. I've found that using SLES is difficult as there don't seem to be any archives of packages for it avaliable.
            I know others have gotten Debian to RHEL to install on the Altix, but I was looking for a more modern OS. I first attempted to install Gentoo, which did work, but since Gentoo removed IA 64 support, I dont think its worth documenting this process.
