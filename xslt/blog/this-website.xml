            <a href="https://github.com/nsafran1217/cde-website">GitHub for the website "source"</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            When I originally made a website, I used Publii, which is a WSYIWYG static site generator. Publii worked good, but I wanted a bit more control over the layout and organizaiton of the site.<br></br>
            <a href="http://www.cosam.org/">cosam.org</a> was my inspiration for the layout of the site, with a sidebar that changed depending on the page.<br></br>
            <a href="https://www.4dwm.com/">4dwm.com</a> indpired me to make the site look like a CDE/HP VUE/4DWM desktop. 
            This ended up being a lot of work since I have no experience with web design, except for one class I took in 10th grade making websites in Adobe Dreamwever CS3 (which was very outdated by then).
            Orignally, it was going to look much closer to cosam.org. I was planning on using <a href="https://simplecss.org/">https://simplecss.org/</a> for the styling, but ended up just making my own.<br></br>
            </p>
            <p>
            I also wanted the site to be static, so I can host it for free on GitHub Pages. I also wanted no JavaScript, so older computers would at least load the site, even if all the styling didn't work.
