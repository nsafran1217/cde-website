                <h2>Ultra 1</h2>
                <p>I have two Sun Ultra 1s. Both of these systems came out of a basement and have a decent
                    amount of rust on the chassis. Unfortunately, one of the systems never worked correctly.
                    It would display MMU error while running self tests. I was able to find a replacement
                    motherboard for a good price on ebay, so now both of the systems work.</p>
                <p>The first unit has a 143MHz UltraSPARC with 256MB of RAM running Solaris 8 and OpenBSD
                    6.9. The other with the replacement motherboard has a 167 MHz UltraSPARC with 192MB of
                    RAM running Solaris 8. All three hard disks are 15k 36GB Ultra320 SCSI disks.</p>
