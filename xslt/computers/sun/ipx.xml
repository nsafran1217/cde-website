            <h2>SPARCStation IPX</h2>
            <p>I really enjoy the lunchbox form factor of the IPX. I purchased this SPARCStation IPX on
                ebay as untested, but it did say it powered on. My system came with a dummy load
                installed where the hard disk would be, so I'm assuming it never had a hard disk and net
                booted Sun OS when it was in service.</p>
            <p>I installed a 2.1 GB Hard disk and purchased a SCSI cable for it. Of course, the NVRAM
                battery was dead. I repaired it by bypassing the internal battery and installing an
                external battery holder as described on this page. <a

            <p>The system currently has 40MB of RAM and is running SunOS 4.1.4, the last release of the
                BSD based operating system by Sun. The GUI on SunOS is pretty simplistic compared to the
                later versions of Solaris, but it works. I compiled some modern tools for it including
                bash, tar, gzip, and others. Its definitely the slowest workstation I have, but I enjoy
                messing around with it.</p>

            <h2>External Hard Disk</h2>
                <p> I really like the form factor, so I purchased an external hard disk on eBay to go with
                    it. This disk was sold as *not working, does not power up*. When it arrived, I opened up
                    the PSU and saw what I expectedâ€”leaking capacitors. I ordered replacements on DigiKey
                    for the four large capacitors and replaced them. Luckily, that was the only issue with
                    the power supply. </p>
