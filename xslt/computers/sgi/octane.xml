                <h2>Octane</h2>
                <p>The Octane was SGI's successor to the Indigo2, offering impressive graphics capabilities
                    and a modular design. It supports dual CPUs and various expansion cards through its
                    proprietary XIO bus. At the core of its architecture is the Crossbar switch, enabling
                    high-speed communication between the CPU and expansion cards. The system board and XIO
                    cards connect to a front plane via delicate compression connectors with gold fingers
                    that press against the PCBâ€”these are extremely fragile and should never be touched, as
                    even slight contact can cause damage.</p>
                <p>I have two Octanes, though only one is fully functional. Both are later models featuring
                    the updated SGI logo and "Cherokee" power supplies. My working Octane has a system board
                    with dual 300 MHz R12000 CPUs, 2GB of RAM, and ESI/SE graphics. It runs IRIX 6.5.30 on
                    an 18GB hard disk.</p>
                <p>The non-working system has a single 300 MHz R12000 CPU, 1GB of RAM, and EMXI/MXE
                    graphics. Its issue appears to be with the graphics board, as it triggers a kernel panic
                    as soon as X tries to initialize. I attempted running it without the TRAMs (which
                    effectively downgrades it to an SSE), but that didn't help. I even swapped the
                    compression connector from an Octane Personal Video card, since the one on the MXE board
                    looked slightly dirty, but that also made no difference.</p>
                <p>The performance leap from my Indigo2 to the Octane is substantial. The Octane compiles
                    software much faster and feels significantly more responsive in use.
