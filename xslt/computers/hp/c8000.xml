            <h2>C8000</h2>
                <p>The C8000 was HP's last PA-RISC workstation. All later PA-RISC systems lacked graphical consoles. 
                This system features a single PA-8900 1.1 GHz dual-core processor.

                <p>I have HP-UX 11.11 (11i v1) TCOE installed, as it is the latest version that supports the C8000. I've been working on getting pkgsrc running but haven't had much success yet. 
                HP-UX 11 has proven to be very particular about compilers and linkers, and I have yet to find a reliable way to compile software for the system.
                <br></br>
                I'm sure its just something I'm doing wrong.
