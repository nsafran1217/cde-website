            <h2>HP 715/100</h2>
                <p>The case design of the 700 series workstations is pretty basic, but it does have an industrial charm that I can appreciate. Some of the later Visualize systems, such as the C360, have a much more appealing design.</p>
                <p>I have HP-UX 10.20 installed on the system, along with some open-source software from the HP-UX Porting Archive. Since many packages for 10.20 were erased, I had to find them on archive.org. I scraped all the copies and versions of the HP-UX Porting Archive, including mirrors, from archive.org and combined them into one directory tree. Eventually, I'll host this mirror somewhere.</p>
                <p>I also need to figure out if a SCSI replacement board will work in this system, as the original 4.2 GB disk is failing. Most of the time, when I turn it on, the disk is stuck, and I need to pick up the system and rotate it while the disk tries to spin up.</p>
