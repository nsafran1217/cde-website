<h1>This Website's Design</h1>

<p><em>Published: 22-May-2025 - Last Updated: 22-May-2025</em></p>

<p>When I originally made a website, I used Publii, which is a WSYIWYG static site generator. Publii worked good, but I wanted a bit more control over the layout and organization of the site.</p>

<p>I had a few goals for the site: Make it static, so I can host it on GitHub Pages, no Javascript so older browsers can at least load the site, and for it to be somewhat easy to update with new content.

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cosam.org/">cosam.org</a> was my inspiration for the layout of the site, with a sidebar that changed depending on the page. <br />
<a href="https://www.4dwm.com/">4dwm.com</a> inspired me to make the site look like a CDE/HP VUE/4DWM desktop. </p>

<p>Making this website ended up being a lot of work since I have no experience with web design, except for one class I took in 10th grade making websites in Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 (which was very outdated by then).
Orignally, it was going to look much closer to cosam.org with a simpler theme. I was planning on using <a href="https://simplecss.org/">https://simplecss.org/</a> for the styling, but ended up just making my own.  </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The first draft of the site was all HTML with a small amount of Javascript to load the navbar on each page, but that didn't meet my goal for no JS. I then came across <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_intro.asp">xslt</a>, which allows you to use a template file to convert an XML file into an HTML file.</p>

<p>With some help from ChatGPT, I started tweaking the template to insert the navbar template on each site. The xslt template also let me generate multiple "Windows" on the site relatively easily. </p>

<p>xslt templates are in <code>/src/templates</code>. All the XML and MD files are in <code>/src/content</code>. </p>

<p><code>make-website.sh</code> calls <code>gen-blog.sh</code>, which converts the markdown into xml, then creates the <code>index.html</code> page for the blog list. </p>

<p><code>gen-articles.py</code> converts all the xml files into html with xsltproc. ChatGPT made this script and is over complicated. One day I'll replace it with a shell script.</p>

<p><code>gen-index.py</code> is currently a mess. The goal was to get an excerpt from each blog entry to have on the home page. It kind of works, but is very complicated. Also written by ChatGPT.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I'm happy with how the website looks on modern browsers, but old browsers struggle a lot with most of the css formatting used to make the "windows". I'm not sure if there's a solution to that, but at least the text loads on old browsers.</p>
