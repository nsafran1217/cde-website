<h1>Modern Linux on SGI Altix</h1>

<p><em>Published: 22-May-2025 - Last Updated: 23-May-2025</em></p>

<p>I recently purchased two SGI Altixes,  <a href="/computers/sgi/altix.html">an Altix 350 and Altix 3700.</a>
The IA64 Altix computers came with a RHEL based distro, then switched to SuSE Enterprise Linux Server (SLES). The latest officially supported is SLES 11, which I installed fine on both atlixes. <br />
SLES works okay, but I've found that using it is difficult as there don't seem to be any archives of packages for it avaliable.</p>

<p>I know others have gotten Debian to install on the Altix, but I was looking for a more modern OS. 
I first attempted to install Gentoo, which did work, but since Gentoo removed IA 64 support, I dont think its worth documenting this process. 
My rough notes are here:  <a href="https://gist.github.com/nsafran1217/c51affd600a221dfd1e22941ad069cb3">Getting circa 2022 Gentoo IA64 on an SGI Altix 350</a></p>

<h2>T2 SDE Linux</h2>

<p>I was pointed at  <a href="https://www.t2sde.org/">T2 SDE Linux</a>, which is a source based distro that supports IA64, by one of the devs working on out of branch Linux kernel support for IA64.</p>

<p>I bootstrapped T2 from my Gentoo install, but I think it should be possible to do it from a SLED 11 install as well.</p>

<p>UNDER CONSTRUCTION: I will clean up these notes next time I install on the Altix 3700. I also need to figure out elilo on T2.</p>
