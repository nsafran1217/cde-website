            <h2>Indy</h2>
            <p>The Indy is my favorite Silicon Graphics machine, just for the case design. 
            I love the color, the speckled finish, and how the case looks like its fractured horizontally.</p>
            <p>The Indy is well known for being underpowered, an "Indigo without the go". 
            I agree with that sentiment after using it when compared to my Indigo2.</p>
            <p>I have 2 Indy's, both very similarly specced. One has a 80 pin SCSI disk with an adapter, and the other has a BlueSCSI v2. 
            I never got the BlueSCSI working perfectly in this system, but I'm sure I just need to change a few settings.
            Both have Irix 6.5.22 installed, which probably is a little much for these computers. 
            I should downgrade to an earlier release of 6.5, or even 5.3 on one of them. 
            6.5.22 is the latest version of Irix that will run on the Indy and other IP22 architecture machines.</p>
            <p>Overall Irix is a very nice Unix, and the 4Dwm window manager feels very snappy, even on the underpowered hardware.</p>
