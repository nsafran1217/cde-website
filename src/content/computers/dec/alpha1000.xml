                    <p>I received this machine for free because it had a faulty power supply. After
                        disassembling the power supply, I didn't find any visible damageâ€”just a loose screw. I
                        reassembled it, and surprisingly, the power supply worked fine.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I first got the system, I couldn't access the ARC firmware console. Entering "arc"
                        at the SRM console would display "ARC firmware loaded" and then freeze. After some
                        research, I found a post on Vogons describing a similar issue on an AlphaStation.
                        Following the same repair method for the Dallas DS1287 TOY NVRAM resolved the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>I currently have OpenVMS 8.4, Tru64 5.1B, Windows NT, and Windows 2000 installed on the
                    system.
