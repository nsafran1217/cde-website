                <h2>VT 240</h2>

                <p>The VT240 is a graphics terminal made by DEC. It supports ReGIS vector graphics and
                    emulates a Tektronix 4010/4014. My VT240 has a green phosphor monochrome monitor.

                    It seems that the case has been painted. The plastic underneath the paint is noticeably
                    yellowed. I'm not sure if it came from DEC this way or if someone painted it in the
                    past. I'm assuming it came from DEC like this, as I found it in a closet at work.

                <h3>ReGIS Graphics</h3>
                <p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/nsafran1217/svg2ReGIS">python script</a> to convert
                    an svg file to ReGIS commands to demonstrate the graphics capabilities of the terminal.

                <h3>Tektronix Emulation</h3>
                <p>This is an example of the tektronix 4010/4014 emulation. The text is unreadable and the
                    graphics are not the correct aspect ratio. I'm not sure if there is a monitor available
                    that would display the graphics correctly.</p>
