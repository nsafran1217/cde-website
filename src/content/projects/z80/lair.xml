            <h2>Z80 Logic Analyzer Interface Board</h2>
            <p>
            When I was first getting started with writing assembly, I found it very difficult to
            know what was happening after I burned the ROM and turned the comptuer on.<br></br>
            I purchased an Agilent 1670G to connect to the comptuer and get some visability into
            what the computer was doing. There is an inverse z80 assembler avaliable for the 1670G,
            which make it very easy to decode what the computer is doing.
            <br></br>
            This board is a clone of the 
            <a href="https://github.com/MustBeArt/LAIR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAIR Pro</a>
            for the RC-2014 bus. I only changed the bus connection to fit my 40 pin layout.
